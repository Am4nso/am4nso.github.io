<h3><strong>SERVICES</strong></h3>
<p>We require a 50% upfront payment for security reasons. This allows us to begin work on your order
    and to secure some payment in the event that the full amount is not paid. This document will be shown in case of a
    chargeback.</p>

<p>All payments must go through PayPal Goods and Services, as demanded by PayPal's user agreement. PayPal is also our
    only current payment method. In the case of a chargeback, we will escalate through PayPal. We shall provide all

    Delivery.
    Upon the expiry of the Revision Period, we are not liable for issues, problems or bugs occurring in the Delivery.
    We may reject a Revision request during the Revision Period for any reason.</p>

<p>All text messages and media files sent
    to the Channel are recorded and stored for security reasons and will be provided as evidence in case of a
    chargeback.

<h3><strong>REFUND</strong></h3>

<p>We have a strict no refund policy. Once a project has started, we will not issue a refund.</p>

<p>However, under a few circumstances, a refund may be initiated:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Missed Deadline: If no Delivery was received by the Client after the deadline, we may give a partial refund
        following 10% per day upto 75% of the commission’s price depending on the amount of time allowed, any changes
        requested by
        the client, and the size of the job. We evaluate each incident on a case by case basis.
    </li>
    <li>
        Unsatisfactory product: If a client is not happy with the product provided, we may give a refund of a maximum of
        15%, and the product will be fixed to the customer’s standards. This is only when the request is marginal, and
        if the requests were outlined in the original agreement. We reserve the right to deny this request.
    </li>
</ol>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 1.5;"><br></div>

<p>We reserve the right to charge an extra amount before or after the Client receives the Delivery under the condition,
    but not limited to: </p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Additional work: In the event that the Client wishes to alter the Order or add an additional service or add a
        request not present in the original agreement as is not relevant to an issue resulting from work done or an
        issue with the product, we are entitled to charge extra. Regardless on the time of the event.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change in Order when at least 50% complete: If a considerable change to the project is requested after the
        original request has reached 50% completion, you may also ask for a price increase. In this case the original
        50% paid will be kept, and you may issue a new quote.
